The second time through you will see the **toast** about why I think I need these permissions; then I finally accept them.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nThis requires NativeScript 2.0 or greater\r\n\r\n## Installation \r\n\r\ntns plugin add nativescript-permissions\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the module you just `require()` it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar permissions = require( \"nativescript-permissions\" );\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## You ask, how exactly does this help?\r\nThis wraps up the entire Android 6 permissions system into a nice easy to use promise. In addition, you can also have multiple permissions pending and each one will resolve properly.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar permissions = require('nativescript-permissions');\r\npermissions.requestPermission(android.Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS, \"I need these permissions because I'm cool\")\r\n  .then(function() {\r\n     console.log(\"Woo Hoo, I have the power!\");\r\n  })\r\n  .catch(function() {\r\n     console.log(\"Uh oh, no permissions - plan B time!\");\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe explanation won't be showed unless they have denied the request once.\r\n\r\n## Why use this?\r\nThis simplifies the checks and allows you to have two courses of action depending on the results of the permission request.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### Functions\r\n#### permissions.hasPermission(permissionName);\r\n- **permissionName** - The permission you are requesting.\r\n- **returns** Boolean - true or false\r\n\r\n#### \\<Promise> = permissions.requestPermission(permissionName, explanation);\r\n- **\\<Promise>** - the **.then()** path will be permission granted, the **.catch()** will be permission denied\r\n- **permissionName** - The permission you are requesting - REQUIRED\r\n- **explanation** - This can be either a string that will show as a toast at the top of the screen **or** this can be a function callback that will be called so that you can show whatever you want. - OPTIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\n#### \\<Promise> = permissions.requestPermissions(\\[permissionName, permissionName, ...], explanation);\r\n- **\\<Promise>** - the **.then()** path will mean ALL permissions were granted the **.catch()** means some or all permission were denied\r\n- **permissionName(s)** - The ARRAY of permissions you are requesting - REQUIRED\r\n- **explanation** - This can be either a string that will show as a toast at the top of the screen **or** this can be a function callback that will be called so that you can show whatever you want. - OPTIONAL\r\n\r\nThe granted or failed promise will return an object keyed to the your permissionName Like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"contact\": true,\r\n  \"camera\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are granted and receive all permissions, then it will resolve with the granted permission promise.  If you failed to get even one of the permissions then it will then resolve the failed/catch promise; then you can use the object list to determine which permission(s) you failed and were granted by the end user.\r\nSo in the above example object, this would have been resolved to the failed promise because you failed to get the camera access.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nBecause this uses support.v4; this code works on ALL versions that nativescript supports currently.  So you can start coding this into your app at this point and your app should work on everything.\r\n\r\nYou still need to put all the permissions you need in the manifest as usual, even on Android 6.    On Android 6 you ALSO must ask the user for permissions each time you go to do anything that needs a \"dangerous\" permission.  You can see all the permissions at [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html).\r\n\r\nWarning: even though the application has been granted permissions once, does NOT mean the app still has permissions; the user can revoke the \"dangerous\" permissions even while the app is running.  So again YOU MUST use requestPermissions each time.  If the app still has the permissions you will be granted it immediately without the user seeing a dialog.\r\n\r\nIn NativeScript when using the permissions names/strings in your code; they are accessed as: android.**Manifest**.permission.PERMISSION_NAME rather than the android.permission.PERMISSION_NAME that you would put inside the manifest and are listed on the Android documentation site listed above.\r\n\r\nThe Android manifest that you need to put the permissions in also is located at `/app/App_Resources/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`\r\n",
